EMAILJS CREDENTIALS SETUP
==========================

From your EmailJS dashboard, I can see:
✅ Service ID: service_mlz7qmq

You still need to get these 2 values:

1. TEMPLATE ID:
   - Go to "Email Templates" in your EmailJS dashboard
   - Click on the template you created (or create one if you haven't)
   - The Template ID will be shown (e.g., template_xxxxxxx)
   - Copy it

2. PUBLIC KEY:
   - Go to "Account" → "General" in your EmailJS dashboard
   - Scroll down to find "Public Key"
   - Copy the Public Key (it's a long string of letters and numbers)

Once you have both values, update your .env file with:

REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_mlz7qmq
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id_here
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here

Then restart your server with: npm start
